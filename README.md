# NoLang
The programming language without much of a philosophy, where nothing means nothing (and a lot of things mean nothing).

## Manifesto? Manifest...no.
1. In NoLang, every expression that you might recognize as "empty" is recognized by the interpreter as equivalent:

`nil == 0 == '' == [] == {}`.

2. NoLang is designed to be friendly! It will fall somewhere between Python and Ruby in terms of handling the hard stuff for you with helpful built-in methods (with, imo, the best scripting tools from both and the worst from neither).

3. NoLang is a scripting language first. It's not trying to replace Java. It's meant to make automation and SREish tasks easier.
